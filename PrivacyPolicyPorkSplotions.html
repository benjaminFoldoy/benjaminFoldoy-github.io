            <h2>
                3.1    Advertising
            </h2>

            <p>
                Advertising funds our Game, allowing us to make our Games free of charge. In our Games, we show our own ads and also ads from third parties. We also advertise outside of our Game on third-party properties such as websites or applications. This section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers. An “Advertising ID” is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of a device. It is consistent across applications from different publishers. The Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (“GAID”) on Android devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes. You can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes. Using the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID. For example, you can “limit ad tracking” on iOS devices or “opt out of interest-based ads” on Android devices. These settings are specific to each device, and you should set them to your desired preference on each of your devices individually. It may take some time for your updated settings to take effect. Please note that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                For more information on mobile privacy settings, you may refer to third-party resources such as:
            </p>

            <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice" target="popup">https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</a>

            <p>
                When you see ads in our Games, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may also collect information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs). In each case, they may use your data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalise the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID). For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed <a href="Advertising.html" target="popup">here.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                When you see our ads outside of our Games (for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Games. Ad networks may also use your data to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    limit the number of times you see our ads,
                </li>
                <li>
                    inform users who have previously played our Game about new content, updates, or other news related to those Game, or 
                </li>
                <li>
                    refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In addition, ad networks may provide services where they use Advertising IDs or other identifiers to find users who are likely to be interested in our Game because their past activity or interests are similar to those of others known by the ad network to use our Game.
            </p>

            <p>
                For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Games, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad. Measurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads. It is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behaviour, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.

                After the applicable retention period, we will either delete or de-identify your data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible. We may continue to use data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregate data).
