TXT%%Somebody knocks on the door, fucking hell, it's way to early for this... Steve tucks himself reeeeaaaaaaaally nicely into the duvet and falls back into sleep.
TXT%%The knocking continues...*knock*...<b class="shake2">*knock*</b>...<b class="shake2">*KNOCK!!*</b>
TXT%%Steve tries to think of ways to stop the super loud noise. More specifically: ways that doesn't involve him moving.
TXT%%But no... There is no suck way....
TXT%%He decides the best cause og action, requirering the least amount of effort, is to toss one of his socks at the window. The idea is to notify the person making the noise that they should stop.
TXT%%Flawless!

TXT%%Steve throws his sock as hard as he can, from a lying position.
TXT%%Unfortunately, the sock barely makes it to the window, before making a soft thump, moving the curtains...
TXT%%Is this enough?
TXT%%The knocking finally stops...
TXT%%Finally, Steve closes his eyes again, and awaits a healthy 15-16 hours of more wonderful sleep.

DVN%%<b class="shake2>I CAN SEE YOU, STEVE! COME OUT!!!</b>
TXT%%Steve opens his eyes, half stunned, half amazed over this outcome he was not expecting from this wonderfully clever, and well thought out sock plan.
TXT%%Inbetween the curtains, a face which can only be described as disappointed-dad-like. Though this is no dad... This is fucking Devin.
