                To access your data in our Game or to request its deletion, please send an email including what you want deleted to LameGames.Contact@gmail.com. These tools are specific to each of our Games. You will find them in the game settings under “Terms & Privacy” or a similarly named option. Using this method, you can also opt out of our personalised offers, where applicable. We ask you to primarily use this method to submit requests, because that helps us validate, process, and fulfill your request more quickly and reliably.

                To exercise any of your rights, contact us at benjaminfoldoy@gmail.com. To fulfil requests submitted by email, we may need to confirm your identity to verify your right to make the request, which may involve requesting additional information from you. For example, we may ask you to provide sufficiently detailed information about the account to which the request relates to enable us to confirm that you are the account holder or acting on their behalf. While we will usually not do so, we reserve the right to charge you an appropriate fee for the exercise of your rights where permitted by applicable laws and regulations.
